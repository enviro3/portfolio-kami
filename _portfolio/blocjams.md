## Description 
Bloc-Jams is the pilot project for students studying Software Development at Bloc. Bloc-Jams is a dynamic web music player that has a main page, a collection page, and an album page. The album page has multiple tracks that can be be played by clicking on the track icon or by using the dynamic player bar. The user can switch between tracks using the playerbar and play/pause as well.  

## Learning Journey
Bloc-Jams was a multiple step journey to get to the product it is today. At first I created Bloc-Jams entirely in HTML/CSS and Vanilla Javascript. Then I adapted the website to use jquery to help make pages come alive with a little animation. For maximum efficiency, I then learned how to turn Bloc-Jams into a web application with Angular. I reformatted the entire program to use the AngularJs platform.
